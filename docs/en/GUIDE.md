# Overall Outline

Kakao Notification Plugin is designed to act as a means of sending notifications to the users via KakaoTalk.

Kakao Notification Plugin is required to set up a **phone number list** of users who want to receive notifications.

For those who wish to use this plugin, you must first register an **Alert Channel** to register a list of phone numbers
that
you want to receive notifications.

When you register an alert channel, alerts are sent to the phone number list you entered when you registered the alert
channel every time an event or alert occurs.

KakaoTalk alert channel registration process can be done in two ways - (1) Project-wide and (2) Personal - depending on
the scope you want to apply.
